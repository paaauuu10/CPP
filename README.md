# CPP MODULES (00-09) - 42 SCHOOL

## OVERVIEW
This repository contains my solutions for the C++ modules (00 through 09) from the 42 School curriculum. Each module introduces fundamental C++ concepts, progressively building from basic syntax to advanced features

## MODULE BREAKDOWN

- Streams (std::cout, std::cin)
- Basic file I/O

### CPP-01: Memory Allocation
- new/delete operators
- References vs pointers
- Filestreams
- Switch statements
- Basic class design

### CPP-02: Advanced Class Features
- Ad-hoc polymorphism (function overloading)
- Orthodox Canonical class form
- Fixed-point numbers
- Operator overloading basics

### CPP-03: Inheritance
- Inheritance concepts
- Multiple inheritance
- Virtual destructors
- Abstract classes and interfaces

### CPP-04: Subtype Polymorphism
- Polymorphism with virtual functions
- Pure virtual functions
- Abstract classes
- Deep vs shallow copying

### CPP-05: Exceptions
- Try/catch blocks
- Standard exceptions
- Custom exception classes

### CPP-06: C++ Casts
- static_cast
- dynamic_cast
- reinterpret_cast
- const_cast
- Type conversion operators

### CPP-07: Templates
- Function templates
- Class templates
- Template specialization
- STL containers basics
- Template metaprogramming intro

### CPP-08: STL Containers
- Vector, list, map, stack, queue
- Iterators
- Algorithms
- Container adapters

### CPP-09: Advanced Concepts
- STL algorithms
- Custom allocators
- Thread basics

## HOW TO USE
1. Navigate to specific module:
   `cd CPP0x/`
2. Navigate to specific exercise:
    `cd ex0x/`
2. Build with make:
   `make`
3. Run executables as shown in subject

## NOTES
- Follows C++98 standard (unless noted)
- Orthodox Canonical form used where required
- Each module builds on previous knowledge
- Some modules contain multiple exercises

Developed as part of 42 School's C++ modules
